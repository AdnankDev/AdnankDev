## üöÄ About Me
I am Adnan Khan, a highly motivated and results-driven BS Information Technology student, ranked in the **top 1%** of my class.  
My academic journey blends a strong technical foundation with leadership experience, having led multiple successful projects from concept to deployment.

With a passion for **Cybersecurity** and **Full Stack Development**, I combine creativity, problem-solving, and critical thinking to design solutions that are not only functional but secure.  
My technical expertise spans HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, C++, PHP, MySQL, MongoDB, and frameworks like React, Node.js, and Express.  
I am proficient with version control tools like Git/GitHub and have hands-on experience in responsive web design, backend API development, and database management.

I believe in **learning by doing** ‚Äî building real-world projects, experimenting with new technologies, and constantly challenging myself. Outside of coding, I‚Äôm an avid reader of self-improvement books, having completed over 7 titles focused on growth and productivity.

**Short-term goal:** Develop my skills as a Cybersecurity Analyst while delivering impactful projects as a Full Stack Developer.  
**Long-term goal:** Serve as a **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)**, leading secure and innovative digital transformations.
